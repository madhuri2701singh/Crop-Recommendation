# Crop-Recommendation
# Overview

This project focuses on crop recommendation by analyzing agricultural datasets using machine learning models. The primary goal is to predict the most suitable crop for a given set of soil and climatic conditions. The models used in this project are:

1)Decision Tree Classifier

2)Logistic Regression

The accuracy of the dataset is evaluated using these models to determine the best-performing approach.

# Dataset

The dataset consists of various soil and climate parameters, including:

1)Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K)

2)Temperature

3)Humidity

4)pH Level

5)Rainfall

6)Recommended Crop

# Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python and the necessary dependencies installed:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

# Usage

1) Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crop-recommendation.git
cd crop-recommendation

2) Run the Python script to train and evaluate models:

python crop_recommendation.py

3) The script will output the accuracy of Decision Tree and Logistic Regression models.

# Model Evaluation

1)The dataset is split into training and testing sets.

2)Models are trained using Decision Tree and Logistic Regression algorithms.

3)Accuracy and performance metrics are evaluated.

4)The best-performing model is identified based on accuracy scores.

# Results

1)The accuracy of Decision Tree and Logistic Regression is compared.

2)The model with the highest accuracy is recommended for crop prediction.
